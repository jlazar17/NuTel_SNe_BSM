\begin{abstract}
Neutrino telescopes, including IceCube, can detect galactic supernova events by observing the collective rise in photomultiplier count rates with a sub-second time resolution. Leveraging precise timing, we demonstrate for the first time the capability of neutrino telescopes to explore new weakly coupled states emitted from supernovae and subsequently decaying to neutrinos. Our approach utilizes publicly available packages, \texttt{ASTERIA} and \texttt{SNEWPY}, for simulating detector responses and implementing neutrino fluxes originated from Standard Model and new physics. We present results for two new physics models
employing a specific supernova model and introduce the tool developed for testing a diverse range of new physics models.
