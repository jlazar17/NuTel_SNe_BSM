\begin{abstract}
Neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube, have promised precise time resolutions at the millisecond level for detecting collective rise signals in all photomultiplier.
We demonstrate that such precise time resolutions will play a crucial role in tracking neutrino signals with novel timing patterns related to weakly interacting massive particles in physics beyond the Standard Model.
Focusing on a future Supernova explosion in the operation time of IceCube as an example, we show that neutrino telescopes can provide unprecedented probes of new particles with both low and high masses from probing early-glow and after-glow neutrino signals, respectively, while comparable to DUNE and Hyper-K in the intermediate mass region.
